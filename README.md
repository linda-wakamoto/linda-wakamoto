## üìÇ Table of Contents

**UCLA MASDS Assignments/Projects (Python)**

1. [**Predictive and Generative AI Final Project**](https://github.com/linda-wakamoto/linda-wakamoto/blob/main/NEW_Final_Code.ipynb): My code for my STATS414: Predictive and Generative AI Course. We were tasked to use predictive modeling and generate synthetic data on the CTR Prediction - 2022 DIGIX Global AI Challenge dataset.
   Predictive Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost
   Synthetic Data tool used: CTGAN
2. [**Machine Learning Final Assignment**](https://github.com/linda-wakamoto/linda-wakamoto/blob/main/ML_Final_code.ipynb): My Machine Learning course final assignment, where I made functions for XGBoost and SVM.

**Other Projects**

1. [**Google Data Analytics Case Study**](https://github.com/linda-wakamoto/linda-wakamoto/blob/main/Google_DA_Case_Study.Rmd): My case study that I completed for the Google Data Analytics Course. I analyzed Fitbit user data to provide app update recommendations for a fitness app company called Bellabeats.

2. [**Boston University Summer Institute of Biostatistics and Data Science - Infectious Diseases Group Project**](https://github.com/linda-wakamoto/linda-wakamoto/blob/main/SIBS_Infectious_Diseases_Project.Rmd): An undergraduate data science research project that I completed with fellow undergraduates at Boston University's Summer Institute of Biostatistics and Data Science Program. We analyzed Ukranian adult data to find a possible correlation between migrant status and drug-resistant Tuberculosis prevalence.
   Model Used: Logistic Regression

**Brown University Assignments (R)**

1. [**Applied Regression Analysis Final**](https://github.com/linda-wakamoto/linda-wakamoto/blob/main/PHP_1511_Final.Rmd): My final project for the Applied Regression Analysis course that I took at Brown University. My partner and I used the dataset and replicated the analysis from the article ‚ÄúAssociation Between Blood Lead Level With High Blood Pressure in US (NHANES 1999‚Äì2018)‚Äù. We cleaned the data, extracted the relevant variables, merged data from consecutive years to one overall variable, did regression analysis, created tables, and stratified tables.
