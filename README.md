**Projects**

1. **Google Data Analytics Case Study** (Google_DA_Case_Study.Rmd): This is my case study that I completed for the Google Data Analytics Course. I analyzed Fitbit user data to provide app update recommendations for a fitness app company called Bellabeats.

2. **Boston University Summer Institute of Biostatistics and Data Science - Infectious Diseases Group Project** (SIBS_Infectious_Diseases_Project.Rmd): This is another undergraduate research project that I completed with fellow undergraduates at Boston University's Summer Institute of Biostatistics and Data Science Program. We analyzed Ukranian adult data to find a possible correlation between migrant status and drug-resistant Tuberculosis prevalence.

**UCLA MASDS Assignments (Python)**

1. **Machine Learning Coursework 2**: (ML HW 2) This is my Python code that trained a multilayer perceptron using Adam optimizer. It allows for a flexible number of layers and number of nodes in each layer. It uses x as a unit square and y as points within a unit circle.

**Brown University Assignments (R)**

1. **Applied Regression Analysis Final** (PHP_1511_Final.Rmd): This is my final project for the Applied Regression Analysis course that I took at Brown University. My partner and I used the dataset and replicated the analysis from the article ‚ÄúAssociation Between Blood Lead Level With High Blood Pressure in US (NHANES 1999‚Äì2018)‚Äù. We cleaned the data, extracted the relevant variables, merged data from consecutive years to one overall variable, did regression analysis, created tables, and stratified tables
